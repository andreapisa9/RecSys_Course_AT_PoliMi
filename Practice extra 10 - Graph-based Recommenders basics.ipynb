    "\n",
    "In layman terms, a graph is a set of **interconnected entities**. Each entity is represented by a *node*, while the connections are called *edges*. Thus, mathematically speaking, a graph $G \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ can be represented as two sets, $N$ (nodes) and $E$ (edges).$$G = (N,E) \\\\ N = \\{x_i | i \\in [1, |N|]_{\\mathbb{N}}\\} \\\\ E = \\{\\{x_i, x_j\\} | x_i,x_j \\in N\\}$$"
